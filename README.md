# DevOps Monitoring Stack: Nagios, Prometheus, and Grafana with Docker

This repository sets up a **DevOps Monitoring Stack** consisting of **Nagios**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana** using **Docker** containers, and is designed for seamless monitoring and alerting of your infrastructure and applications.

## Stack Overview
- **Nagios**: A monitoring tool that provides alerts and status reports for your systems, services, and network.
- **Prometheus**: A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for cloud-native applications. It collects and stores time-series data, ideal for containerized environments.
- **Grafana**: A data visualization platform that integrates with Prometheus to create dashboards and alerts based on your metrics data.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- Docker installed on the host machine.
- Ansible (for setting up and automating the environment).

### 1. **Run the Ansible Playbook**
This playbook will set up the necessary environment and configurations for the monitoring stack. To run the playbook, execute the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible_monitoring_setup.yml
```
### 2. Test Nagios Configuration
To verify the Nagios configuration, use the following command inside the Nagios Docker container:

```bash
 docker exec -it nagios nagios -v /opt/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```
This will check the Nagios configuration for any errors or issues.


### 3. Test Ping Inside Nagios Docker Container
You can test the Nagios plugin for ping by running the following command inside the Nagios container:

```bash
docker exec -it nagios /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_ping -H vveeo.com -w 100.0,20% -c 500.0,60%
```
This command checks the ping response from vveeo.com, with specified warning and critical thresholds for packet loss and response time.

### 4. Default Nagios Credentials
By default, the Nagios admin username and password are set to:


Username: nagiosadmin

Password: nagios

Note: Make sure to change these credentials after testing to secure your environment.

### Additional Information
Nagios is used for basic monitoring and alerting, including host, service, and network monitoring.

Prometheus scrapes time-series metrics data and stores them for querying, visualization, and alerting.

Grafana integrates with Prometheus to create customized, interactive dashboards that provide insight into system health and performance.
